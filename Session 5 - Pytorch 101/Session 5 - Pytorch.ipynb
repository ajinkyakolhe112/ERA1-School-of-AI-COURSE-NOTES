        "\n",
        "It has several components that you'd like to be aware of (from future perspective):\n",
        "* PyTorch is production ready. With **torchScript**, PyTorch provides ease-of-use and flexiblility in _eager_ mode, while seamlessly  transitioning to graph mode for speed, optimization, and functionality in C++ runtime environments.\n",
        "* **TorchServe** is an easy to use tool for deploying PyTorch models at scale. It is cloud and environment agnostic and supports features such as multi-model serving, logging, metrics and the creation of RESTful endpoints for application integration.\n",
        "* Optimized performance in both research and production by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication that is accessible from Python and C++.\n",
        "* PyTorch supports an end-to-end workflow from Python to deployment on iOS and Android. It extends the PyTorch API to cover common preprocessing and integration tasks needed for incorporating ML in mobile applications.\n",
        "* An active community of researchers and developers have built a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for extending PyTorch and supporting development in areas from computer vision to reinforcement learning.\n",
        "* Export models in the standard **ONNX** (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for direct access to ONNX-compatible platforms, runtimes, visualizers, and more.\n",
        "* The C++ frontend is a pure C++ interface to PyTorch that follows the design and architecture of the established Python frontend. It is intended to enable research in high performance, low latency and bare metal C++ applications.\n",
        "* PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling through prebuilt images, large scale training on GPUs, ability to run models in a production scale environment, and more.\n",
